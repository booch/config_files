Mac OS X Configuration
======================

These Ansible playbooks will configure Mac OS X the way we want, including:

  * Configuring OS preferences
  * Installing applications
  * Configuring applications

These scripts are written for macOS Sierra (10.12).


Requirements
------------

You'll need Ansible and Homebrew.
This presents a "chicken and egg" problem -- we install Homebrew via Ansible,
but also install Ansible via Homebrew.
To resolve this, you can start with either, or both.
It's probably easiest to start with Ansible:

~~~ shell
sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install ansible
~~~

Or, starting with Homebrew, then Ansible:

~~~ shell
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew install ansible
~~~

We typically use newer features in Ansible, so be sure you've got the latest release.
(The above procedures install the latest.)

Another "chicken and egg" problem is that using `git` the first time will
prompt you to install some XCode tools.
Just accept that if you're prompted.

Note that some of the tasks will prompt you for your password to complete the installation,
so this isn't a 100% "fire-and-forget" process.


Usage
-----

First, clone the repository:

~~~ shell
git clone https://github.com/boochtek/mac_config.git
cd mac_config
git checkout ansible
~~~

Next, edit `inventory_for_mac_serial_number.sh` to add your computer to the list.

Then edit `mac_vars.yml` to your preferences.

Finally, run the playbook:

~~~ shell
ansible-playbook -K mac.yml
~~~

You'll be prompted for your password, as well as your Mac App Store ID and password.
You can just hit `Enter` on the Mac App store prompts, if you won't be installing anything from the Mac App Store.
The list of App Store apps to be installed are listed in `appstore_apps_to_install` in the `mac_vars.yml` file.

Most roles and included tasks have tags, so you can run a subset of tasks.
This can be helpful when writing and testing a new task.
For example:

~~~ shell
ansible-playbook -K mac.yml -t keyboard
~~~

You can also leave out the `-K` if you know you won't need sudo access,
and you won't be prompted for your password.

The entire playbook will take several hours to run; many packages will be downloaded and compiled.
Even if nothing new needs to be installed, the playbook will take about 8 minutes to run.
