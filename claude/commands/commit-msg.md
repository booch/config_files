# Commit Message Command

Suggest a commit message for the currently staged changes:

1. Run `git --no-pager diff --cached` to see staged changes
2. If there's nothing staged, use `git --no-pager diff` instead
3. Analyze what changed and why (infer purpose from the diff)
4. Suggest a concise commit message that:
    - Summarizes the "why" not the "what"
    - Follows best practices for commit messages
    - Uses imperative mood ("Add" not "Added")
5. If the code was fully generated by AI, indicate that with a trailer tag:
    - `AI-Generated-By: <model> <version> (<tool>)`
6. If the code was assisted by AI, indicate that with:
    - `AI-Assisted-By: <model> <version> (<tool>)`

If nothing is staged, say so.
