# Review Chat Session

Analyze our conversation in this session and provide a brief retrospective:

1. **What went well** - Effective patterns, good collaboration moments
2. **What could improve** - Miscommunications, wasted effort, missed opportunities
3. **Suggestions** - Concrete changes for future sessions, such as:
   - Updates to AGENTS.md
   - Additional skills or commands
   - Better ways to communicate intent
   - Workflow improvements

Keep the review concise and actionable. Focus on patterns, not individual mistakes.
Don't commit any of the changes.

The end goal is to learn from our mistakes and our successes.
